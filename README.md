# AI Website

## Purpose
This project is for my DevOps 320 class.  
It is a simple website I made using AI.  
I learned how to upload files to GitHub and publish a live website.

## Steps I Took
1. I installed Git on my computer.  
2. I opened PowerShell and went to my website folder.  
3. I typed `git init` to start Git.  
4. I added my files using `git add .`  
5. I saved my changes with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`  
6. I made a new public repo on GitHub called **ai-website**.  
7. I connected it with  
   `git remote add origin https://github.com/ramojog/ai-website.git`  
8. I pushed my files using  
   `git branch -M main`  
   `git push -u origin main`  
9. I turned on GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages to make my site live.  

## Challenges
- I got an error message about “main” not matching any branch.  
  I fixed it by renaming my branch with `git branch -M main`.  
- My website first showed a 404 page.
